# oldSchool

I found my old domain (stay-monkey.net -- named after a song by Bikini Kill frontwoman, Kathleen Hanna aka Julie Ruin)through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/sitemap/http://stay-monkey.net" target="new">Wayback Machine</a> and was surprised to see some of my old layouts.

It is apparent that I was mildy obsessed with iframes back in the day, so I decided to pick out one of the simple layouts and recreate the flow.

This was a great way to learn web design, blog layout, digital imaging and FTP servers. I hosted two other web designers, had multiple 'web cliques', was part of many 'web rings' and got up to 16 different layouts for my little part of the web.

A little bit of nostalgia writing this as it was WAYYY before MySpace, Facebook, etc. In the late 1990's / early 2000's you either had a geocities/angelfire page or you figured out how to make a cool one.
