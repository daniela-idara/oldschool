  <p>My name is Daniela Archibong.</p>
  <p><img src="../assets/daniela.jpg" height="219px" width="292px"></p>
  <p>I have always had an interest in design, internet and programming.</p>
<p>My first computer was the <a href="https://clickamericana.com/media/advertisements/introducing-the-computer-age-vtech-precomputer-1000-1988" target="new">
  PREcomputer1000</a> that came with a manual on learning BASIC programming.</p>
<p>In junior high, I owned my own domain that allowed me to design 'web cliques' and host other people interested in creating their own website.</p>
  <p>I joined my junior high's afterschool club, 'TechnoHawks', just so I had faster internet I could use to upload files through my FTP server.</p>
  <p>Throughout high school, I took digital imaging classes and learned how to manipulate photos through photoshop, illustrator, etc.</p>
  <p>After years of technical support roles, I realized my passion is in knowing how things work and building projects. 
    I am actively working on re-learning what I taught myself in the past as well as expanding my knowledge in various programming languages.
    Also, I am working on learning the various tools that are used in group projects in a professional environment.</p>
  <p> Most recently, I am teaching myself how to use the terminal in Linux to work on as many projects as I can. I am working on a Ubuntu 18.04LTS setup on my Lenovo IdeaPad.</p>
